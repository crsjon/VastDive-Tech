    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Hi, We are <strong>Ebonalo &amp; Bitos</strong>, a passionate IT student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) degree at Cebu Eastern College (CEC). We are currently in first year of college and have always been deeply interested in the world of technology, programming, and software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our journey into the IT field started with a fascination for how computers work and the endless possibilities that coding and software development can offer. We enjoy studying and working on creative and challenging projects, especially those involving web development, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. Our goal is to master multiple programming languages and develop innovative software solutions that can make a real impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        At CEC, We had the opportunity to collaborate with talented Teachers and classmates, explore various areas of IT, from front-end web development to back-end infrastructure. We are constantly learning and improving our skills in languages like HTML, CSS. Building personal projects and participating in coding challenges have helped me sharpen my problem-solving abilities and expand my technical knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we are not coding, We love diving into tech articles, exploring new software tools, and staying updated on the latest advancements in the tech industry. We believe that the future belongs to those who understand technology, and we are excited to be part of this evolving world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer and eventually specialize in artificial intelligence and machine learning. We are excited to continue this journey and face the challenges that come with it. We are passionate about creating impactful solutions and contributing to the growing tech community.
